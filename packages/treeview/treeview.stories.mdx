# @zendeskgarden/container-treeview

This package includes containers relating to Treeview in the
[Garden Design System](https://zendeskgarden.github.io/).

This package offers a headless implementation of the
[W3C TreeView Design Pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#TreeView) and offers
[accessible navigation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/treeview/treeview-2/treeview-2a.html#kbd_label)

## WAI-ARIA support

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard Interaction</summary>

  See [source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#keyboard-interaction-22). For a vertically oriented tree (horizontal and RTL are supported as well):

  -   When a single-select tree receives focus:
  -   If none of the nodes are selected before the tree receives focus, focus is set on the first node.
  -   If a node is selected before the tree receives focus, focus is set on the selected node.
  -  ❌ When a multi-select tree receives focus:
  -   If none of the nodes are selected before the tree receives focus, focus is set on the first node.
  -   If one or more nodes are selected before the tree receives focus, focus is set on the first selected node.
  -   ✅ `Right arrow`:
  -   When focus is on a closed node, opens the node; focus does not move.
  -   When focus is on a open node, moves focus to the first child node.
  -   When focus is on an end node, does nothing.
  -   ✅ `Left arrow`:
  -   When focus is on an open node, closes the node.
  -   When focus is on a child node that is also either an end node or a closed node, moves focus to its parent node.
  -   When focus is on a root node that is also either an end node or a closed node, does nothing.
  -   ✅ `Down Arrow`: Moves focus to the next node that is focusable without opening or closing a node.
  -   ✅ `Up Arrow`: Moves focus to the previous node that is focusable without opening or closing a node.
  -   ✅ `Home`: Moves focus to the first node in the tree without opening or closing a node.
  -   ✅ `End`: Moves focus to the last node in the tree that is focusable without opening a node.
  -   ✅ `Enter`: activates a node, i.e., performs its default action. For parent nodes, one possible default action is to open or close the node. In single-select trees where selection does not follow focus (see note below), the default action is typically to select the focused node.
  -   ❌ Type-ahead is recommended for all trees, especially for trees with more than 7 root nodes:
  -   Type a character: focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the typed character.
  -   Type multiple characters in rapid succession: focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the string of characters typed.
  -   ❌ `*` (Optional): Expands all siblings that are at the same level as the current node.
  -   ❌ **Selection in multi-select trees:**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Roles, States, and Properties</summary>

  See [source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tree_roles_states_props)

  - ✅ All tree nodes are contained in or owned by an element with role `tree`.
  - ✅ Each element serving as a `tree` node has role `treeitem`.
  - ✅ Each root node is contained in the element with role `tree` or **❌❓referenced by an `aria-owns`
  property set on the `tree` element.**
  - ✅ Each parent node contains or owns an element with role `group`.
  - ✅ Each child node is contained in or owned by an element with role `group` that is contained in or
  owned by the node that serves as the parent of that child.
  - ✅ Each element with role `treeitem` that serves as a parent node has `aria-expanded` set to false
  when the node is in a closed state and set to true when the node is in an open state. End nodes do
  not have the `aria-expanded` attribute because, if they were to have it, they would be incorrectly
  described to assistive technologies as parent nodes.
  - ❌ The `tree` role supports the aria-activedescendant property, which provides an alternative to moving DOM focus among `treeitem` elements when implementing keyboard navigation.
  - ❌ If the `tree` supports selection of more than one node, the element with role `tree`
  has `aria-multiselectable` set to true. Otherwise, `aria-multiselectable` is either set to false
  or the default value of false is implied.
  - ❌ If the `tree` does not support multiple selection, `aria-selected` is set to true for the
  selected node and it is not present on any other node in the tree.
  - ❌ if the `tree` supports multiple selection:
  - All selected nodes have `aria-selected` set to true.
  - All nodes that are selectable but not selected have `aria-selected` set to false.
  - If the `tree` contains nodes that are not selectable, those nodes do not have
  the `aria-selected` state.
  - ✅ ❓The element with role `tree` has either a visible label referenced by `aria-labelledby` or a
  value specified for `aria-label`.
  - ❌ If the complete set of available nodes is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the
  user moves focus in or scrolls the tree, each node has `aria-level`, `aria-setsize`,
  and `aria-posinset` specified.
  - ❌ If the `tree` element is horizontally oriented, it has `aria-orientation` set to `horizontal`.
  The default value of `aria-orientation` for a tree is `horizontal`.

## Usage

### Example

The Hooks and Container stories are using the same `EndNode` and `ParentNode` components. Here is their implementation:

```tsx
import React, { forwardRef, HTMLProps } from 'react';

interface INodeProps extends HTMLProps<any> {
  name?: any;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}

const EndNode = forwardRef<HTMLLIElement>(({ name, ...props }: INodeProps, ref) => (
  <li ref={ref} role="none">
    <a href={`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/${name}`} {...props}>
      {name}
    </a>
  </li>
));
EndNode.displayName = 'EndNode';

const ParentNode = forwardRef<HTMLLIElement>(({ name, children, ...props }: INodeProps, ref) => (
  <li ref={ref} {...props}>
    <span>{name}</span>
    {children}
  </li>
));
ParentNode.displayName = 'ParentNode';

const Group = props => <ul {...props} />;
```


### Hooks ([story](?path=/story/treeview-container--hook))

<Canvas>
  <Story id='treeview-container--hook'/>
</Canvas>

### Container ([story](?path=/story/treeview-container--container))

<Canvas>
  <Story id='treeview-container--container'/>
</Canvas>

### (Advanced) Use Context for deep nested trees
