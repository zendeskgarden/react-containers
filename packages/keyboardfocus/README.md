### useKeyboardFocus

The `useKeyboardFocus` hook supplies state and props that help you to distinguish
between mouse and keyboard focus.

```jsx
import { useKeyboardFocus } from '@zendeskgarden/container-keyboardfocus';

const KeyboardFocus = () => {
  const { getFocusProps, keyboardFocused } = useKeyboardFocus();

  return (
    <div {...getFocusProps()}>{keyboardFocused ? 'Keyboard focused!' : 'Not keyboard focused'}</div>
  );
};
```

### KeyboardFocusContainer

`KeyboardFocsuContainer` is a render-prop wrapper for the `useKeyboardFocus` hook.

```jsx
import { KeyoardFocusContainer } from '@zendeskgarden/container-keyboardfocus';

<KeyboardFocusContainer>
  {({ keyboardFocused, getFocusProps }) => (
    <div {...getFocusProps()}>{keyboardFocused ? 'Keyboard focused!' : 'Not keyboard focused'}</div>
  )}
</KeyboardFocusContainer>;
```
